Flot plugin for rendering pie charts. The plugin assumes the data is 
coming is as a single data value for each series, and each of those 
values is a positive value or zero (negative numbers don't make 
any sense and will cause strange effects). The data values do 
NOT need to be passed in as percentage values because it 
internally calculates the total and percentages.

* Changes:
        2009-10-22: lineJoin set to round
        2009-10-23: IE full circle fix, donut
        2009-11-11: Added basic hover from btburnett3 - does not work in IE, and center is off in Chrome and Opera
        2009-11-17: Added IE hover capability submitted by Anthony Aragues
        2009-11-18: Added bug fix submitted by Xavi Ivars (issues with arrays when other JS libraries are included as well)
                

Available options are:
series: {
        pie: {
                show: true/false
                radius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'
                innerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect
                startAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result
                tilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)
                offset: {
                        top: integer value to move the pie up or down
                        left: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'
                },
                stroke: {
                        color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')
                        width: integer pixel width of the stroke
                },
                label: {
                        show: true/false, or 'auto'
                        formatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text
                        radius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length
                        background: {
                                color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#000')
                                opacity: 0-1
                        },
                        threshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to hide labels (if they're too small)
                },
                combine: {
                        threshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to combine slices (if they're too small)
                        color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#CCC'), if null, the plugin will automatically use the color of the first slice to be combined
                        label: any text value of what the combined slice should be labeled
                }
                highlight: {
                        opacity: 0-1
                }
        }
}
