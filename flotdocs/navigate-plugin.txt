Flot plugin for adding panning and zooming capabilities to a plot.

The default behaviour is double click to zoom in, drag to pan. The
plugin defines plot.zoom({ center }), plot.zoomOut() and
plot.pan(offset) so you easily can add custom controls. It also fires
a "plotpan" and "plotzoom" event when something happens, useful for
synchronizing plots.

Example usage:

  plot = $.plot(...);
  
  // zoom default amount in on the pixel (100, 200) 
  plot.zoom({ center: { left: 10, top: 20 } });

  // zoom out again
  plot.zoomOut();

  // pan 100 pixels to the left and 20 down
  plot.pan({ left: -100, top: 20 })


Options:

  zoom: {
    interactive: false
    trigger: "dblclick" // or "click" for single click
    amount: 1.5         // 2 = 200% (zoom in), 0.5 = 50% (zoom out)
  }
  
  pan: {
    interactive: false
  }

  xaxis, yaxis, x2axis, y2axis: {
    zoomRange: null  // or [number, number] (min range, max range)
    panRange: null   // or [number, number] (min, max)
  }
  
"interactive" enables the built-in drag/click behaviour. "amount" is
the amount to zoom the viewport relative to the current range, so 1 is
100% (i.e. no change), 1.5 is 150% (zoom in), 0.7 is 70% (zoom out).

"zoomRange" is the interval in which zooming can happen, e.g. with
zoomRange: [1, 100] the zoom will never scale the axis so that the
difference between min and max is smaller than 1 or larger than 100.
You can set either of them to null to ignore.

"panRange" confines the panning to stay within a range, e.g. with
panRange: [-10, 20] panning stops at -10 in one end and at 20 in the
other. Either can be null.
